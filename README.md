# Background

I am currently a first-year Master's student in mathematics at ENS Rennes. I first completed two years of intensive preparatory classes (MPSI–MP*) in Lycee Carnot (Dijon), then joined ENSAE Paris, where I pursued in parallel a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the Magistère of Mathematics in Orsay (Paris-Saclay University) . This dual academic path enabled me to pass the second entrance exam for the Écoles Normales Supérieures and join ENS Rennes.

For the past five years, I have known that I wanted to specialize in mathematics applied to finance, data science, and artificial intelligence. I have therefore built this customized academic path to reach those goals.

This repository gathers a collection of projects I have completed during my studies or in my personal time, covering both machine learning and quantitative finance topics.

# Personal Projects: Machine Learning & Quantitative Finance

The Machine Learning projects include :  
- Classification of users based on keystroke dynamics (using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Algorithm), Discriminant Analysis and Cross-Validation).
- Prediction of authors’ birth years from word occurrence patterns in literary texts (using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), LASSO and Ridge regression).
- Classification of five cancer types from gene expression data (using k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), Decisions trees, Random forest and AdaBoost).

The Quantitative Finance projects include :
- None for the moment.


*This repository is regularly updated as I progress in my learning and projects.*
