# Personal Projects: Machine Learning & Quantitative Finance

This repository contains a collection of projects I have completed during my academic studies as well as in my free time, covering areas in machine learning and quantitative finance.

The Machine Learning projects include :  
- Classification of users based on keystroke dynamics (using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Clustering (Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Algorithm), Discriminant Analysis and Cross-Validation).
- Prediction of authors’ birth years from word occurrence patterns in literary texts (using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), LASSO and Ridge regression).
- Classification of five cancer types from gene expression data (using k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), Decisions trees, Random forest and AdaBoost).

The Quantitative Finance projects include :
- Implement a European call option (using the Black–Scholes closed-form formula) and plot the price as a function of volatility.


Each project is presented as a well-documented Jupyter notebook to facilitate understanding and reproducibility.

*This repository is regularly updated as I progress in my learning and projects.*
